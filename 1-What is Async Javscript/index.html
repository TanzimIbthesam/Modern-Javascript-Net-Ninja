  <!-- Async Javscript 
  Start Now and finish Later 
  Governs how we perform tasks which takes some time to complete -->
  <!-- Sync Javscript -->
<!-- //Javscript by nature is synchronous it can run only one statement at a time -->
<!-- In synchronous it is known as blocking code as it stops next line of code from running
   It can only run one line of data at a time
 One statement is executed at a time in a single thread
 Any function could take 2-3 seconds to complete or even longer
 2 secs might not be long but we can have multiple functions to get data 
 it would block all code from running unless those are completed

Statement-1 
Statement-2-takes-time---Database--|
Statement-3-takes-time
Statement-4
Callback-------------------------- 
Tasks which takes time to complete Synchr programming not the best practice
For that reason Async programming is best start now and finish later

We see que of function calls 
we use async function to execute that data
Browser takes the request and handles it outside the scope of this single thread in another half of the browser
It take s callback function and puts it to another side too it executes it later on when the data comes back
If that network or specified request has been taken out of this thread Js can run down the que and run remaining function

It makes our code non blocking because rest of the coding can be executed
