  <!-- HTTP REQUESTS -->
  <!-- Sometimes we need to show data in a website 
  We need to show stuff that is stored in database or another kind of server somewhere
  we make Http requests to reach out that external server from that data or do something with it
  
  We make request to API end points
  API endpoints are like URLS that particular API or server exposes so that we can used to get data from them
  song library like spotify or soundcloud 
  From our browser we would make request to a server endpoint
   I would send it back as a response 
   we get data in our code we can render it as a browser 
   We can get API from Facebook,Twitter,Instagram and each API is goind to have its own set of endpoints 
   Each API has its own set of API we can make our own API using a server side language PHP Node JS Puby Python
   Once we make a request to an endpoint we are going to get selection of data in a format called as JSON
   JSON-Javascript Object Notation
   We need to interact with API endpoints to make requests 
   when we want to get data from somewhere we make a get request
   the data when we request while we get is JSON data
   we will interact with API enmdpoints and make HTTP requests with it
